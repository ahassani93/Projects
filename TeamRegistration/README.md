Description: A team registration website with form validation and MySQL database
connection. The website has two pages. One page is the registration form, and 
the other is the registered members. The form contains name, address, phone, email,
and DOB. Validation of each field is performed using wildcards, and errors are shown
for each field separately. The submit button only registers a new member if
no field contains an arror. The registered members page retrieves all member
information from the database and presents members as records in a tabular format.
PDO methods are also used for security in database connection.
